# Analyze NYSE Data
Background: In this project I analyzed real life data from the New York Stock Exchange. I will be drawing a smaller subset of a large dataset provided by Kaggle that contains historical financial data from S&P 500 companies. 
What skills will I use?

The main goal of this project is to demonstrate my ability to:
```
* interpret the measures of central tendency and spread (mean, median, standard deviation, range)
* use a combination of Excel or Google Sheets functions (e.g., IF statements, INDEX and MATCH, calculating descriptive statistics with the IF statement, drop downs, data validation).
* analyze and forecast financial business metrics using MS Excel.
* create visualizations of a business metric and use Excel to create a financial forecast model.
```
# Understanding the Data
Cleaning Up The Data

I ensured all the column names to have no spaces, but still be informative. This isn't necessary, but just a recommendation. The following information is included in the Project data NYSE file:
```
* Ticker symbol: Stock symbol
* Years: Number of years for which data is provided
* Period ending
* Total revenue
* Cost of goods sold
* Sales, General and Administrative expenses
* Research and Development expenses
* Other Operating expense items
* Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS) Sector: Industry sector the company is categorized under (e.g., American Airlines with the ticker symbol AAL is categorized under Industrials.)
* GICS Sub Industry: Sub-industry sector the company is categorized under (e.g., AAL is further categorized under the sub-category of Air
```
# Project Goals
Here are the three tasks that you will complete in the final project.

Task 1:

a. Identify the question about the data that you will answer based on your data analysis, and include this in your slide presentation.\
Your question should include at least one categorical variable (GICS Sector or GICS Sub Industry) and one quantitative variable (one of the financial metrics) and require the use of at least one of the summary statistics.\
A tab within the Excel spreadsheet that you submit should include the summary statistics [measures of central tendency (e.g., mean, median) and measures of spread (standard deviation and range)] you used to answer your question.\
Deliverable: Slide presentation, Spreadsheet with tab for Summary statistics

b. Your slide presentation should provide at least one visualization to help with your answer.\
This visualization might be a bar chart, histogram, scatterplot, box-plot or other visual that you learned to make. Include your insights from the measures of center and spread and at least one numeric summary statistic in the description.\
Deliverable: Slide presentation (includes visualization)

Task 2:

Create a dashboard for a Profit and Loss Statement that calculates the Gross Profit, Operating Profit or EBIT for a company selected from a drop-down list.\
Your drop-down list should pull historical fundamentals data to create the P&L Statement.\
The P&L statement should include the Gross Profit, Operating Profit or EBIT values for all the years there is historical data available for that company in the dataset.\
Deliverable: Spreadsheet with tab for Dynamic P&L statement

Task 3:

Create a financial model for a company (different from Task 2) of your choice that forecasts out the Gross Profit, Operating Profit or EBIT for two more years using three scenarios (Best case, Weak case and Base case).\
Your assumptions for revenue growth, gross margin and operating margin should change for each scenario.\
The forecasting model should be dynamic for the selection of the case (Weak, Base, Strong). However, the forecasting model can be static for the chosen company sticker symbol.\
Deliverable: Spreadsheet with tab for Forecasting Model

Once you have finished analyzing the data, create a presentation that shares the visual and summary paragraph. The summary paragraph should clearly communicate your findings based on your analysis, and provide visual or numeric values associated with your summary.

# Dynamic P&L Statement
I cleaned the data to only show the information related to companies in the energy sector. In the picture below, you can see its a dynamic PNL statement where the values for the cost, profit and revenue changes for each company.
