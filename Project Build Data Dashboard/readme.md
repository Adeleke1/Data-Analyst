# Flight delay and cancellations
**Project Description**\
In this project, I'll create visualizations to reveal insights from a data set. This data comes from a Kaggle dataset, it tracks the on-time performance of US domestic flights operated by large air carriers in 2015. You can find the dataset in supporting materials at the Misc folder. My work will be a reflection of the theory and practice of data visualization, such as visual encodings, design principles, and effective communication.

Delay is one of the most remembered performance indicator of any transportation system. Commercial aviation players understand delay as the period of time by which a flight is late or postponed. Thus, delay may be represented by the difference between scheduled and real times of departure or arrival of a flight.
Flight delays have negative impacts, particularly economic, for passengers, airlines and airports.

Given the uncertainty of their occurrence, passengers usually plan to travel many hours before their appointments, increasing their trip costs, to ensure their arrival on time. On the other hand, airlines suffer penalties, fines and additional operation costs, such as crew and aircrafts retentions in airports.

Due to this, I had some questions in mind which I believe will help to understand the underlying causes of delays and cancellations.
1. What contribute mostly to flight delays?
2. Which month has the most departure delay in 2015?
3. What state in America does flight cancellation occur the most?
4. What are the reasons for flight cancellations by airlines at various airport?

**Insight 1: What contribute mostly to flight delays?**

In this visualization, we can see the various reasons for flight delays. It is visible that late aircraft delay is the major reason why flight delay occurs. Also, the least contribution to delay came from delay due to security.

**Insight 2: Which month has the most flight departure delays?**

From this illustration, the best time to travel is September due to the minimal average amount of departure delay averaging 4.8 minutes. The month of June proves to be quite a difficult time to travel as the departure delay averaged an amount of 15 minutes.

**Insight 3: Which state in America does flight cancellation occur the most?**

Texas had the highest amount of flight cancellations among the states in America reaching a sum amount of 668 cancellations. This shows that it is not advisable to rely on an urgent flight to Texas due to the high flight cancellation rate. On the other hand, Montana rarely experience flight cancellations as the sum amount of cancelled flight amount to just 3.

**Insight 4: What are the reasons for flight cancellations by airlines at various airport?**

Across all airport in America, Southwest airlines experience the most amount of cancellation. For this airline, the conditions that led to flight cancellation were mostly due to weather amounting to 446, followed by airline carrier of 309 and lastly National Air System of 63.\
Hawaiian Airlines experienced the least cancellation of flight summing upto 8. The only reason for flight cancellation for this airline came from Airline/Carrier.

You can check the dashboard where I have put together these different visualization to see why flight delay and cancellation occurs in each state, airports and airline.
